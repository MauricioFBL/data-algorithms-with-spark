# Goal of this book: Data Algorithms with Spark

1. Keep it SIMPLE!

2. Goal of this book: enable writing efficient & 
  simpler PySpark code for data algorithms using Spark

3. A lot of [working PySpark code](../code/) is provided 
   so that the reader can understand how to use basic 
   transformations on using RDDs and DataFrames
   
4. As much as possible, I have avoided writing complex 
   code and functions: keep it simple so that you can 
   debug easily and your co-workers can understand them.
   
5. CUT-and-PASTE: you may take portions of the [code](../code/) 
   and tailor it to your needs
